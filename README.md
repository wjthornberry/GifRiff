# GifRiff
Who doesn't love GIFs, those little animated snippets of hilarity, oddity, and, above all, brevity? This is a dynamic web page that utilizes the GIPHY API to populate the page with gifs of your choice.

The page comes pre-populated with an Arrested Development theme. Clicking on a button loads ten random gifs related to the particular keyword, but if Arrested Development isn't your thing, you can also  add your own buttons â€” how cool is that? You can view the finished project <a href="www.jakethornberry.net/GifRiff" target="_blank">here</a>.
